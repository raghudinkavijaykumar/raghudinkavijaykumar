## Experience

### SDE - Full Stack Cloud | Boeing (Aerospace) | June 2018 – Present

- Binary flight sensor data translation using different AIRINC formats based on flight data types using Hadoop batch jobs to generate ORC, CSV, H5 files.
- Design and migration of sensor data translation into a GCP Cloud Native architecture to use serverless dataflow streaming jobs with object format store in Cloud Storage. Operator and Input File type clustered and File and parameter-based partitioned store in BigQuery. For military data, setting up RabbitMQ messages integration and using self-managed Kubernetes cluster and helm managed deployment. Comparative feature analysis of Apache Beam to use both Direct and Dataflow Runners.
- Analysis of performance and BigQuery query optimizations to scan minimal data required. Query and Storage cost optimization in BigQuery loaded data and GCS federated data.
- Separation of data access layer for multiple services from a monolithic standpoint and implementation using Spring Wedlux and Data JPA, with multi-tenant architecture and deployment on GKE.
- Automated load test Using Jmeter and integration with CI to run on major version upgrades.
- Designing and implementing a data-archival process for flight data accessible across multiple organizations, mainly after the 737-MAX crisis.
- Integrating development with Gitlab CI build and JFrog Artifactory push. Continuous deployment pipelines to multiple environments using parallel Jenkins pipelines with relevant control.
- Web portal development for easy onboarding applications/people into the platform using React and Confluence integration.
- Collection of Boeing India Glassdoor reviews and tagging with topics and pain points using Sentiment analysis and Word Cloud representations.
- Careful feature/change analysis to understand downstream application inputs to achieve none to minimal impacts. Downstream applications teams include prognostics and flight tests.
- Active participation in cross-product insight sessions and Product Reviews, understanding the architecture of the applications and technological relevance.
- Day-to-day tasks include design, code, test, and monitoring applications under my scope and follow test-driven developmental practices with Agile software developmental methodologies co-ordinating under multiple teams curating and discerning requirements into parallel-delegatable tasks.
- Recognized multiple times for exceptional performance and honored with Pride@Boeing awards.

### SDE - Full Stack | Tayana Software Solutions (Telecom) | July 2016 – June 2018

- Worked as part of the application development team on various telecom products following protocol specifications concerning subscriber operations, loyalty programs, charging functions.
- A comprehensive read throughput analysis of In-Memory data grid using MySQL NDB cluster of 4 VM's with a replication factor of 2 for high availability and no data loss, to achieve 1 million transactions per second.
- Implementation of JNI interface to communicate with the shared library for charging protocols like Diameter, OSA Parlay, OCS-XML, PreTUPS to perform debiting, crediting, user-specific operations, and exposing them as REST-APIs.
- Implementing multi-threaded architecture and optimization of code to improve performance up to 1000 transactions per second.
- Understanding GTP and GTPv2 protocols to unit and load test of all the supported request and response flows to enable a quick roaming facility.
- Worked under multiple teams with collaboration.
- Ingestion of EVR and CDR using Kafka streams.
